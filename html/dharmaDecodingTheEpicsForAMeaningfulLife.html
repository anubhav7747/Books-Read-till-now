            <p class="line-height"><q>Dharma: Decoding the Epics for a Meaningful Life</q> is a non-fiction book by best-selling Indian author Amish Tripathi and his elder sister Bhavna Roy. The book conveys practical and philosophical lessons drawn from ancient Hindu epics.</p>

            <p class="margin-top line-height">The book is written in the form of conversations between characters set in modern-day India. These conversations echo the insights and lessons from Upanishads, Mahabharata, and Amish&apos;s fiction books, the Shiva Trilogy and Ram Chandra series.</p>

            <p class="margin-top line-height">The authors dive into the priceless treasure trove of the ancient Indian epics, as well as the vast and complex universe of Amish&apos;s Meluha, to explore some of the key concepts of Indian philosophy. They discuss multiple dimensions and decode the meaning of several principles of Indian history, deducing myths and mythological characters.</p>

            <p class="margin-top line-height">The book explores questions such as the ideal interplay between thought and action, taking and giving, self-love and sacrifice. It also discusses how to tell right from wrong, how to bring out the best in ourselves, and how to live a life with purpose and meaning, not just one fuelled by the ego and material needs.</p>

            <p class="margin-top line-height"><q>Dharma: Decoding the Epics for a Meaningful Life</q> was released on 28 December 2020 and is published by Westland Publications.</p>
