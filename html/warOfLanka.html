            <p class="line-height"><q>War of Lanka</q> is the fourth book in the Ram Chandra Series by bestselling Indian mytho-fiction writer, Amish Tripathi. The book takes the Ramayana ahead wherein Raavan is ultimately killed by Ram, thus prevailing Dharma over Adharma.</p>

            <p class="margin-top line-height">The first three books in the series told the respective protagonist&apos;s story from their point of view, from their birth till the time Sita was abducted by Raavan. In <q>War of Lanka</q>, Amish interweaves the narratives of the previous books in this series into one and takes the story ahead.</p>

            <p class="margin-top line-height">The book explores the following key questions:</p>

            <ul>
                <li>Will Ram defeat the ruthless and fiendish Raavan, constrained as he is by the laws of Dharma?</li>
                <li>Will Lanka burn to a cinder or fight back like a cornered tiger?</li>
                <li>Will the terrible costs of war be worth the victory?</li>
                <li>Most importantly, will the Vishnu rise? And will the real enemies of the land fear the Vishnu?</li>
            </ul>

            <p class="margin-top line-height">The book is an action-packed retelling of the Ramayana, giving a new perspective to the epic. The development of various important characters and their viewpoints makes this an interesting read.</p>
