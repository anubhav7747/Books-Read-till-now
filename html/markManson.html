            <ul>
                <li>The Subtle Art of Not Giving a F*ck:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">Manson argues that we often waste our energy on trivial things that don't truly matter. The key is to be selective about what we care about, focusing on what is genuinely important to us.</dt>
                
                <li>Life's Inherent Struggles:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">Manson emphasizes that life is inherently difficult, and happiness comes not from avoiding problems but from choosing which problems are worth facing. Embracing life's challenges and struggles can lead to personal growth and fulfillment.</dt>
                
                <li>Values and Priorities:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">The book encourages readers to clarify their values and prioritize what truly matters to them. Manson introduces the concept of "The Subtle Art of Giving a F*ck," suggesting that caring about a few meaningful things is more valuable than pursuing constant positivity.</dt>
                
                <li>Responsibility and Ownership:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">Manson emphasizes taking responsibility for one's life and choices. Instead of blaming external factors, individuals should recognize their agency in shaping their destinies.</dt>

                <li>The Importance of Limits:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">Setting boundaries and recognizing limitations are crucial for a balanced and healthy life. Not everything is worth pursuing, and understanding one's limits allows for more realistic and sustainable goals.</dt>
        
                <li>Acceptance of Negative Emotions:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">The book challenges the cultural obsession with positivity and encourages acceptance of negative emotions. Manson argues that true happiness comes from embracing the full range of human emotions rather than striving for constant positivity.</dt>
        
                <li>The Feedback Loop from Hell:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">Manson discusses how the pursuit of constant positivity can create a negative feedback loop, leading to more dissatisfaction. Acceptance of negative experiences and learning from them can break this cycle.</dt>
        
                <li>Defining Success:</li>
                <dt class="line-height">Manson redefines success, suggesting that it is not about achieving constant happiness or wealth but about living in accordance with one's values and making a positive impact on others.</dt>
